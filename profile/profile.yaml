summary: I am a recent graduate from the University of Wollongong with a Bachelor of Computer Science, majoring in multimedia and game development. 
  During my studies, I have worked on projects covering a wide range of topics including core object-oriented programming principles, algorithms, web development, 
  AI logic, mobile app development, blueprint visual scripting, 3D graphics programming, and much more. After completing my undergraduate degree, 
  I attended the Lighthouse Labs web development boot camp to build my foundation in full-stack web development, 
  where I specialized in the PostgreSQL, Express, React, NodeJS technology stack and gained proficiency with a variety of important topics such as 
  REST API integration, Object-Relational Mapping, continuous integration and delivery, software testing and more.
  
  As a software developer and web developer, I built and maintained efficiently optimized web services together with clients, 
  and I currently work at Jarvis as a data engineer, which enables me to further develop my full-stack engineering skills. 
  In addition to software engineering, I enjoy learning how to cook different cuisines for my family and creating mixed-media art. 
  The interests I have reflected the approach I take to software development, 
  which is to express myself creatively while also providing a valuable service to others.
